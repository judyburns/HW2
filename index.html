					<p>I have spent many years learning about technology, myself, and how the world works. Somehow I knew the three were related, and so I set out on a journey to prove my theory. My scientific experiment to prove my theory started by first going to Indiana University and graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Mathematics. Before leaving college, I secured my first job working for the phone company in Indianapolis, Indiana. There I was trained as a mainframe developer. After establishing stability as a successful programmer, I decided to experience life as a mainframe contractor. During this time, I greatly improved my skills in communication and interactions with all my coworkers, learning how to share ideas to come up with the best possible solutions to business problems. After many years of experience as a mainframe developer gathering much wisdom, I finally embarked upon a new adventure to become a Certified Microsoft Software Developer. This adventure is pretty much an extension of my life as a mainframe developer, but with fresh insights. On the other hand, discovering myself has been another adventure occurring simultaneously with my adventure as a software developer. By taking time to learn about the human body and all of its perspectives, I have discovered that our technology is just an extension of who we are at a deep level; complex beings whose incredible abilities reflect our technological advancements. Yes, my research has revealed to me that technological advancements and our human existence are mirrors to one another. This means to know and understand one is to know and understand the other. And this is how the world works according to Judy Burns!</p>

				<figcaption>
					<p>My hobbies include reading <strong><em>technical</em></strong> books and books about the <strong><em>humany anatomy</em></strong>. Between the two I find parallels between scientific discoveries and the human body to all aspects of our reality. I also love participating in exercises like yoga, tai chi, and other forms of exercise which stress the importance of the mind-body connection.</p>
